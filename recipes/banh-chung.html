    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
        <p>Bánh Chưng is a traditional Vietnamese cake made from glutinous rice, mung beans, and pork, wrapped in green dong leaves and boiled for hours. It is a symbol of the Vietnamese Lunar New Year (Tết) and is deeply connected to the country’s agricultural roots and family traditions.</p>
        
        <p>According to legend, Bánh Chưng was created by Prince Lang Liêu during the Hung Kings’ era to represent the Earth, with the square shape symbolizing stability and harmony. Today, making Bánh Chưng is often a family activity, where members gather to prepare, wrap, and cook the cakes together.</p>
