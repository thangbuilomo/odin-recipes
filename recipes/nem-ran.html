    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>Nem Rán, also known as Vietnamese fried spring rolls, is a beloved dish in Vietnamese cuisine, especially popular during family gatherings, holidays, and festivals. Each roll is filled with a mixture of minced pork, seafood, vegetables, glass noodles, and mushrooms, wrapped in rice paper and deep-fried to golden perfection.</p>

    <p>Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, Nem Rán is typically served with fresh herbs, lettuce, and a dipping sauce called nước chấm. In southern Vietnam, this dish is known as chả giò, and it can be adapted with different fillings according to taste or seasonal ingredients.</p>
