    <h1>Pho Ha Noi - The taste of Hanoi</h1>

    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>Phở Hà Nội, or Hanoi-style beef noodle soup, is one of Vietnam’s most iconic dishes. It features flat rice noodles served in a fragrant, clear beef broth, topped with tender slices of beef and garnished with scallions and herbs. The flavor of the broth comes from slow-simmered beef bones and a blend of aromatic spices such as star anise, cinnamon, and ginger.</p>

    <p>Unlike the southern variation, Phở Hà Nội is less sweet, more delicate in flavor, and served with minimal garnish—allowing the rich broth and quality of the beef to shine. It is enjoyed at any time of the day, but a steaming bowl of phở in the early morning is a cherished Hanoi tradition.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 kg beef bones (marrow and knuckle bones)</li>
        <li>500 g beef brisket</li>

        <li>Remove brisket after 1.5–2 hours, let it cool slightly, and slice thinly. Continue simmering the broth.</li>
        <li>Season the broth with fish sauce, salt, and rock sugar to taste. Strain the broth before serving.</li>
        <li>Cook rice noodles according to package instructions, then drain.</li>
